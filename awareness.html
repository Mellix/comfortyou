        <h1><b>Awareness for Anxiety and Depression</b></h1>
        <h3><p>Growing up in today's society, mental health has become a prominent issue.
        Teenagers are beginning to show early signs of struggles with certain disorders
        like anxiety or depression. Though, some communities are still refusing to accept
        the fact that mental health is signifcant and that it does exist!
        Thus, it is manifesting the stigma that mental health is a joke. However, we
        are here to break down that stigma while providing factual information
        to those who need it and for those who seek help!</p>

        <p>Disclaimer: There are many more symptoms and subcategories of anxiety and
          depression that are not listed!</p>
        <p>Note: <i><b>Hover</b></i> over the different types of anxiety/depression to learn more!</h3>

            <p>"Anxiety disorders form a category of mental health diagnoses that lead to
            excessive nervousness, fear, apprehension, and worry."</p>

            <p>While experiencing anxiety temporarily every day is normal,
            having it recurring constantly isn't. Having anxiety disorders can interfer with
            daily life and create an uneasy environment for a person. For example, a person who
            has anxiety may experience a panic attack right before speaking in front
            of a crowd.</p>

            <p>Though, there are different types of anxiety disorders that exist.
            To differentiate the different subcategories of anxiety disorders,
            we have complied a list of anxiety disorders and their symptoms.</p>

            <p>"Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities."</p>
            <p>It is more than just feeling <em>sad</em> or going through a rough time in life. It’s a serious mental health condition that requires understanding and medical care.
              If left untreated, depression can be devastating for those who have it and their families.
              Fortunately, with early detection, diagnosis and a treatment plan consisting of medication, psychotherapy and healthy lifestyle choices, many people <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> get better.</p>
            <p>Depression does not have a single cause. It can be triggered by a life crisis, physical illness or something else—but it can also occur spontaneously.</p>
