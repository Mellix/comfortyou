        <h1><b>Awareness for Anxiety and Depression</b></h1>
        <h3>Growing up in today's society, mental health has become a prominent issue.
        Young teenagers are beginning to show signs of struggles with certain disorders
        like anxiety or depression. Though, some communities are still refusing to accept
        the fact that mental health is signifcant and that it does exist!
        Thus, it is manifesting the stigma that mental health is a joke. However, we
        are here to break down that stigma while providing factual information
        to those who need it and for those who seek help!</h3>

            While experiencing anxiety in every day life is normal,
            having it recurring constantly isn't. To differentiate the generalized
            anxiety that many may suffer from and the other forms.</p>
