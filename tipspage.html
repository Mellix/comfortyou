      <ol>4. Treat Yourself to Some Dark Chocolate!</ol>
        <des>The flavanoids, caffeine, and theobromine in chocolate are thought

      </des>
      <ol>5. Dance Around!</ol>
        <des>Put some music on and just dance to your heart's content! Dancing
        helps reduce levels of cortisol (stress hormones) and increases your body's
        levels of endorphins.

      <ol>6. Take a Bath!</ol>
        <des>If you have a bathtub, take a bath! You can add Epsom salt to help
          soothe aches and pains, while boosting their magnesium levels.</des>
      <ol>7. Go for a Stroll in the Park!</ol>
        <des>Take a walk and explore the environment you live in! Taking a stroll
          in the park may help you destress and relax.</des>
      <ol>8. Exercise Reguarly!</ol>
        <des> Take some of your time and try exercising! Whether it's stretching
          or weight lifting, sweating all that stress out is helpful!</des>
      <ol>9. Sing to Your Favorite Tunes!</ol>
        <des>Just like dancing, singing without a care can help boost your body's levels
          of endorphins and make you happier/stress-free! You're able to sing
          alone or with friends! In addition, you can do karaoke!</des>
      <ol>10. Spend Some Time With a Furry Friend!</ol>
        <des>If you don't have a pet, spend time at the animal shelter
          or hang out with a friend that has a pet! Spending time with animals
          help lower stress hormone - cortisol, and boosts oxytocin - which stimulates
          feelings of happiness.
